World Life Expectancy SQL – Project Summary

This project explores a world life expectancy dataset using SQL. It includes data on countries, life expectancy, GDP, BMI, adult mortality, and development status over several years.

I wrote SQL queries to find key insights, such as:

Changes in life expectancy for each country over time.

Average global life expectancy trends by year.

How life expectancy relates to GDP, BMI, and adult mortality.

Differences between developed and developing countries.

The project helped me practice exploratory data analysis with SQL and understand health and economic patterns across countries.
